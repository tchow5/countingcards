					<p> This is a counting card simulator. I was inspiried to make this after watching the movie 21 (which is totally awesome) </p> 
					<p> To successfully count cards you must understand that counting cards does not automatically make you rich instead, counting cards improves the chances of winning or having 21(blackjack)</p>

						<p> Basic card counting with 1 deck of cards deals with values that are positive, negative, or neutral. Whenever a face card is dealt (i.e Jack, Queen, King, Ace) it subtracts one from the count. When a card, that is between 7-9 is dealt it does not change the value of the the count. Any number between 2-6 it will add to the current count</p>
